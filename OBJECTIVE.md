# AUTOMATION-IN-AEROPONICS
The goal of the system is to create a safe, sustainable, competitive growing envi-
ronment that produces easily accessible produce for all members of the con-

vides a solution to current agricultural problems through the use of an automat-
ed, optimized and controlled microclimate growing system. 

It is designed to achieve:
• Increased accessibility
• Increased consumer control
• Maximized freshness and quality
• Reduced stress on environment
