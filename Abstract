In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has received much
attention in the areas of industry and academia. Currently, IoT technologies
are being applied in many fields and is changing lives in many areas such as
smart homes, smart cities, smart grids, autonomous cars, and the industrial
internet. Howbeit, traditional agriculture is still waiting for many changes to
occur in networking technology especially in IoT. Many researchers and
engineers are working towards applying IoT technology to traditional
agricultural methods. Aeroponics farming is an efficient and effective process
for growing plants without using soil. When we apply IoT technology to an
aeroponics system, it is expected that there will be many improvements such
as decreasing water usage, increasing plant yield, minimizing rate of growth
and reducing the workforce. In this paper, we designed and implemented a
new automatic aeroponics system using IoT devices. Our system is comprised
of three main components: a mobile application, service platform and IoT
devices with sensors. The mobile application provides the user a graphical user
interface to monitor and adjust the aeroponics system. The service platform is
a middleware system that provides information for the mobile application to
store the gathered information from IoT devices using sensors within the
aeroponics system. The IoT device uses sensors within the aeroponics system
to control each pump and access data. Our work is a new application in the
agricultural industry and is expected to be a promising application that will
help the farmer with increasing productivity in farming and reducing carbon
footprint.
